## Development Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 to structure the content
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- Flexbox for element alignment
- Media queries for responsive card resizing (content inside the card remains unchanged)
- Display `block` and `flex` for layout adjustments
- Yellow and black color palette for a minimalist design

### What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to improve my HTML and CSS skills, especially in terms of applying responsive design principles. I used `media queries` to adjust the card size based on the screen width, ensuring a consistent visual experience on both mobile and desktop devices without altering the content within the card.

#### Example of media query code used:

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 800px) { 
    #content {
        display: block;
        margin-inline: auto;
        width: 327px;
        height: 501px;
        background: white;
        border: 1px solid black;
        border-radius: 20px;
    }
}
```

This code snippet shows how the cardâ€™s size is adjusted to fit within the specified screen width range, keeping the content layout inside the card intact.

### Future Development

I plan to continue exploring responsive design techniques, including adding animations to enhance interactivity. Additionally, I aim to improve my knowledge of CSS variables to streamline style organization and facilitate future customizations.
